/**
 * Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.
 * <p>
 * Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
 * Output: True
 * Example 2:
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
 * Output: False
